Drake Quest is a tool to assist with learning about genetics and the metabolism.  We use the imaginary 
creature the "Drake" as our model organism, for exploring these areas of science.  A drake is a small
dragon like creature, which is a more reasonable size for housing in a laboratory, with a gestation
period that is short enough that we are able to do many breedings within a fairly short period of time.
This allows us to quickly do more extensive experiements in genetics.</p>
