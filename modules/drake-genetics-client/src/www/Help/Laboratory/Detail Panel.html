<h2>Detail Panel</h2>
The Detail panel gives you the ability to examine the phenotype of your drakes more closely.  For any
drakes available in your list you can decide if there is something about this phenotype that would
lead you to believe that you would receive interesting or different results in a metabolic experiment,
before you actually run the experiment.  Also the ability to view the phenotype and attempt to draw
conclusions should you find interesting results as a result of the experiment.
