<h2>Drakes List</h2>
The "Drakes" listing on the left hand side of the interface is a simple expandable list with two
categories "Females" and "Males".  By clicking on the right facing arrow control next to the folder 
icon by each category, you will expand the list with the set of female or male drakes available for 
experiments in the laboratory.
<P>
Each list is initially seeded with some example drakes.
<br><B>Females</B>:
<ul>
<li>P1 - Steel scale, gold eyes
<li>PAT - Sand scale, white eyes
<li>DB - Charcoal scale, red eyes
<li>Scooby - Gold scale, gold eyes, scruffy
</ul>
<B>Males</B>:
<ul>
<li>P2 - Sand scale, white eyes
<li>Shaggy - Sand scale, white eyes, scruffy
</ul>

<b>Usage</b><p>
Usage is fairly straight forward.  Selecting either a female or male will cause this drake
to appear both in the subject field in the Laboratory,
and in the detail panel at the bottom of the window.  You can freely change the subject
with no affect on your laboratory experiment.  The experiment will not be run until you select
"Run Tests" from the Laboratory interface.
<p>
If you want to do experiments with new drakes that are not yet available in your list of drakes,
you'll need to first do a breeding experiment, produce a new drake of interest, and add it to
the list of drakes through the Breeding Pen's detail panel.
