<h2>Metabolism Laboratory</h2>
The metabolism laboratory is where a scientist can experiment with the affects
of diet on a drake's metabolism.
<p>
Similar to the Breeding Pen, the Metabolism Lab has a Drake List and a Detail Panel.  Detail about both
of these is available in the help listing.  The main laboratory then provides controls that allow
you to select a specific drake, do a specific metabolic experiment on the drake, and then view 
plots representing the results of the experiment.
