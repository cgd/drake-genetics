<h2>Metabolism Laboratory</h2>
The metabolism laboratory is where a scientist can experiment with the affects
of diet on a drake's metabolism.
<p>
Similar to the Breeding Pen, the Metabolism Lab has a Drake List and a Detail Panel.  Detail about both
of these is available in the help listing.  The main laboratory then provides controls that allow
you to select a specific drake, do a specific metabolic experiment on the drake, and then view 
plots representing the results of the experiment.
<P>
<b>Subject</b><p>
The subject is the drake with which you will do your metabolic experiment.  You will select this 
drake from the Drakes list on the left.
<p>
<b>Controls</b><p>
The controls included are:
<ul>
<li> Diet - Currently the only diets available are "Standard" and "High in Sugar".  In the future, additional diets will be added, such as "Fatty", etc...
<li> Measure - This lists all of the metabolites that can be measured in our experiment.  The user has the option of selecting any subset of metabolites.
<li> Run Tests - Will initiate the experiment for a given subject, diet and set of metabolites to be
measured.
<li> Clear Tabs - This will remove all of the  plots that have been generated up to this point.
</ul>
<b>Result Plots</b><p>
A plot is generated for each experiment run.  
The line-plot represents the concentration of each selected metabolite over time.
The name of the plots will include the name of the
drake, and the diet that was used.  The plot will include data for each type of measure that was
selected.  Sometimes when the measures have results that are very similar, it is difficult to
see all the plot lines.  Try repeating tests with fewer factors, and you may find the results more
discernable.
<p>
As more tests are run, tabs are added to the display for each experiment.  When there are too many tabs
to view on a single screen, arrows appear for navigating left and right through all of the tabs.  To 
clear away all the tabs, use the "Clear Tabs" button in the controls section.
