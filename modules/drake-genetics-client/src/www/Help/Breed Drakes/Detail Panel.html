<h2>Detail Panel</h2>
The Detail panel gives you the ability to examine the phenotype of your drakes more closely.  For two
drakes available in your list of breeding drakes, it gives you the ability to view the phenotype
before choosing your drakes to breed.  For new progeny, it gives you the ability to view the
new phenotypes, and decide which progeny you would like to add to your breeder list for future, 
experiements.  It should be noted that the breeder list is also used in the Laboratory for experiements,
so if you have a drake in your progeny that you'd like to run a metabolic experiement on, you'll need
to add them to your breeding list from here.

When a drake is still in your progeny pen, you have the ability to select it, and make it available
for breeding and other experiements in your laboratory.  New drakes are automatically named using
the names of the two parents in the cross that produced the progeny.  So if you cross the P1 female
with the P2 male, all the progeny will be named "(P1 x P2)".  This might be fine if you are only going
to keep one of the progeny, but if you want to keep multiple, it might be good to use more meaningful
names.  While the drakes are still progeny, you have the abiltiy to edit the name field and change
the name.  Choose carefully, as once you've made the drake available, this will be it's name 
permanently.  Once you have decided on a drake to keep, and renamed it as you like, you simply select
the "Make Available" button, and the drake will now appear in your Drakes list on the left hand side.
