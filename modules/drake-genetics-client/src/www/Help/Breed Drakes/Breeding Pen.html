The Breeding Pen is where a scientist can experiement with genetics of
the Drake by breeding various combinations of males and females.
<P>
I am intentionally making this a long article so that I can confirm whether or not the scroll bar works and that the text stays
on a single page width wise verses disappearing over the edge of the window.
<p>
<p>
<p>
There is some really
important<br>
information I should include
here
<p>
<p>
... but clearly I haven't.
<p>
<p>
I'll just keep writing until I think I've gone over the bottom of the window
so that I can test to see if a scroll bar comes up automatically.
<p>
It would stink if it didn't.
<p>
I'd have to make additional modifications to the window and panel in the
case where it did not.
