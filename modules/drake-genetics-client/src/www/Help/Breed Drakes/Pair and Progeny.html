<h2>Pair and Progeny</h2>
The Breeding Pair and Progeny panels function essentially as a unit.  The breeding pair are the two
drakes (one female, one male) that are used in your breeding experiment to produce progeny.  The
breeding pair is populated using the Drake list on the left (for more information on this list see
the "Drake List" help topic).  Once you've settled on the pair of drakes you want to breed, you simply
press the "Breed" button and a set of 20 progeny will appear in the Progeny panel below.<p>
The detail panel at the bottom can be used for viewing individual drakes, both the breeding pair and 
the progeny.  See the "Detail panel" help topic to learn more.
<P>
Breeding a pair of drakes will always result in 20 eggs being laid, unless the female in the pair
in infertile.  If the male in the pair is infertile, the progeny pen will include 20 unfertilized
eggs.  In most other cases the progeny pen will be filled with 20 live young drakes.  The exception
here is if the resulting phenotype of the progeny is lethal.  In this case an egg will appear in
the spot where the lethal progeny would appear.
<p>
As you will see through experimentation, unless the pair of drakes you are breeding is genetically
identical, you will find quite an array of phenotypes in your resulting litter of drakes.  Through 
experimentation of repeated breedings of a given pair, and breedings of the resulting progeny
you will learn much about genetics that will be useful with all species, not just this model 
organism.
<P>
There is information about how to add one of your progeny to the list of Breeding drakes in the help
topic for the "Detail panel".
