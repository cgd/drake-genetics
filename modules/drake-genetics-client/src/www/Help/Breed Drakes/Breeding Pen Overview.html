<h2>Breeding Pen Overview</h2>
The Breeding Pen is where a scientist can experiement with genetics of
the drake by breeding various combinations of males and females.
<P>
This interface allows the scientist to select a male and a female drake, add them to a breeding pair, 
examine their individual phenotypes in the detail panel, and then breed a pair.
<p>
Once a pair has been bred, the set of progeny will appear in the Progeny pen.  Drakes will always
lay 20 eggs, and if viable, will result in 20 young drakes.  As you will soon discover, breeding two
drakes can result in progeny with a variety of scale and eye colors, based on the genetics of these
two parents.  The details of this you'll have to explore for yourself!
<p>
For more details about each of the specific components in the breeding pen, view the specific 
detail help pages (links are available in the listing on the left).
