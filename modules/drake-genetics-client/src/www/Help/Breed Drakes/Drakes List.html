<h2>Drakes List</h2>
The "Drakes" listing on the left hand side of the interface is a simple expandable list with two
categories "Females" and "Males".  By clicking on the right facing arrow control next to the folder 
icon by each category, you will expand the list with the set of female or male drakes available for 
breeding.
<P>
Each list is initially seeded with some example drakes.
<br><B>Females</B>:
<ul>
<li>P1 - Steel scale, gold eyes
<li>PAT - Sand scale, white eyes
<li>DB - Charcoal scale, red eyes
<li>Scooby - Gold scale, gold eyes, scruffy
</ul>
<B>Males</B>:
<ul>
<li>P2 - Sand scale, white eyes
<li>Shaggy - Sand scale, white eyes, scruffy
</ul>

<b>Usage</b><p>
Usage is fairly straight forward.  Selecting either a female or male will cause this drake
to appear both in the appropriate position in the breeding pair (female on the left, male on the
right), and in the detail panel at the bottom of the window.  You can freely change the breeding
pair with no affect until you choose breed.
<p>
New drakes can be added to the list via the detail panel.
